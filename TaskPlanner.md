# Task Planner: Guest List Project

## Phase 1: Placeholder Data

- [x] Create placeholder data (id[#], name[str], email[str], phone[str], bio[str], job[str])
- [x] Build guest list display (show name email phone)
- [x] Make guest selection state
- [x] Build guest details view (all above fields)
- [ ] Add back button to deselect guest _I don't think I need to do this_
- [x] Conditional rendering (list vs details) _if(selectedGuest) etc etc_

## Phase 2: API Integration

- [x] Create fetch functions (getAllGuests, getGuest)
- [x] useEffect to fetch guest list on mount
- [x] useEffect to fetch guest details on selection
- [x] Handle loading states
- [x] Handle errors
- [ ] Async Handler? _Skipped, not needed, too few trycatches to care_

## Phase 3: Polish

- [x] Clean up placeholder data
- [x] Test all interactions
- [x] Seems fine? Seems fine.
